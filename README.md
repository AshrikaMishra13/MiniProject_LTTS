# TOPIC: CYBERCAFE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM BY ASHRIKA MISHRA (SF ID: 260267) LTTS
# OBJECTIVES: The purpose behind this is to consolidate the concepts and practices imparted during the course and to serve as a record of competence. The objective of the project is to
1. Reduce Operational Time- Interconnects different computers in a Cybercafe that allows users to communicate over the computer network
2. Increased Efficiency- Manages multiple clients and provide the clients service access to log in
3. Data security- Log-in system provides security from hackers or unauthorized users to gain access to the client server 
# IMPLEMENTATION: The following are the implementations of my project:
1. It can be used by clients who can log in as guests or members and use the facilities provided by the cybercafe
2. It can also be used by clients to request services of a typical cafe such as coffee, tea, and other things.
