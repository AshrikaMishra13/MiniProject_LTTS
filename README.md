# DESCRIPTION: 
The following is the description of my project:
- It can be used by clients who can log in as guests or members and use the facilities provided by the cybercafe
- It can also be used by clients to request services of a typical cafe such as coffee, tea, and other things

# OBJECTIVES: 
The purpose behind this is to consolidate the concepts and practices imparted during the course and to serve as a record of competence. 
- Reduce Operational Time- Interconnects different computers in a Cybercafe that allows users to communicate over the computer network
- Increased Efficiency- Manages multiple clients and provide the clients service access to log in
- Data security- Log-in system provides security from hackers or unauthorized users to gain access to the client server

1. The main Challenge was about not able to calculate monthly expenses and keep record of deficit or surplus amount , Functions for calculation of the total surplus or deficit amount has been made for overcoming the issue. 
2. There was another challenge of not able to keep a record on calculations of provident fund amount, Again a function was made to calculate the amount and give a solution.
